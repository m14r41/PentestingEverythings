# Basics of Active Directory


# Active Directory (AD) - Basics Understanding

#### Common Terms:
- **Domain**: A logical group of network objects (users, computers, devices) that share a common directory database.
- **Forest**: A collection of one or more domains that share a common schema and configuration.
- **Tree**: A hierarchy of one or more domains that are connected in a contiguous namespace.
- **Organizational Unit (OU)**: A container within a domain used to organize users, groups, and computers. OUs can be nested.
- **Group Policy**: A feature that allows administrators to implement specific configurations for users and computers within the domain.
- **Schema**: Defines the objects and attributes that the directory service can contain.
- **Global Catalog**: A distributed data repository that contains a searchable, partial representation of every object in every domain in a forest.

#### Key Components:
- **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**: The core service that provides the directory and authentication services.
- **Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS)**: A lighter version of AD DS, used for directory-enabled applications.
- **Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)**: Provides single sign-on and identity federation for users accessing applications across different organizations.

# Domain Controller (DC)

#### Common Terms:
- **Primary Domain Controller (PDC)**: The main domain controller responsible for processing authentication requests and managing changes in a domain.
- **Backup Domain Controller (BDC)**: An older term (from NT4 days) for a domain controller that provides backup and redundancy for the PDC.
- **Replication**: The process of copying changes made on one domain controller to others to ensure consistency.
- **Trust Relationship**: A connection between two domains that allows users from one domain to access resources in another.

#### Key Components:
- **Active Directory Database**: The database file (NTDS.dit) that stores the directory data and objects.
- **DNS Integration**: Active Directory relies on DNS for domain controller location and service discovery.
- **Authentication Protocols**: Protocols like Kerberos and NTLM that handle authentication requests.

### Summary
- **Active Directory** is the service that organizes and manages network resources.
- **Domain Controllers** are servers that implement AD services, handling user authentication and managing directory data.

 ### Within Active Directory, there are three built-in groups that comprise the highest privilege groups in the director

| **Group Name**        | **Description**                                              |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Enterprise Admins (EA)** | The highest privilege group in a multi-domain Active Directory forest. Members can manage configuration and administrative tasks across the entire forest. |
| **Domain Admins (DA)**     | A high privilege group with administrative access to a specific domain. Members can manage all objects and settings within that domain. |
| **Built-in Administrators (BA)** | The default group for managing administrative tasks on local machines and domain controllers within a domain. |
